This code is written in Python 3 for scraping data from websites.
It contains a class, Scraper, that handles all of the browser navigation
and getting content from the Selenium driver. It requires the selenium
library for Python and the chromedriver by Google.

The "functions.py" file contains all other functions used to control the
main scraper object. All content scraped from the scraper should be
saved in the "./data" directory.

The "run.py" file runs the program to iteratively scrape a site.
